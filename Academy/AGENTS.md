# Academy Laravel + Mobile Community Upgrade – Full Technical Specification

**Scope:** End‑to‑end upgrade of Academy (Laravel) web app and connected Flutter mobile apps to add “Communities” (Skool‑style) with feeds, memberships, paywalls, gamification, calendars, classrooms integration, notifications, security hardening, and full UI/UX refinements. Includes database migrations, backend API, admin dashboards, real‑time services, file storage, search, analytics, and DevOps. we use apache

**Assumptions**

* Current stack: Laravel 9.x/10.x (PHP 8.2+), MySQL 8.x, Redis, Apache & Nginx , Horizon/Queues, Flutter 3.x (Dart 3), Firebase (FCM), S3‑compatible storage, Git.
* Current Academy LMS features: courses, lessons, classrooms, user profiles, roles/permissions, notifications, calendar, search.
* All new features must be **multi‑tenant aware** if applicable and respect existing RBAC.

# 0) Platform Upgrade & Hardening (Foundation) — Enterprise, Modular Plan (Sections 1–3)

> Scope of this tranche: **(1) Laravel Core Upgrade**, **(2) Security Baseline**, **(3) Performance**. Observability will be delivered in the next group.

---

## 1) Laravel Core Upgrade (→ Laravel 11 LTS, PHP 8.3)

### 1.1 Pre‑flight & Risk Controls

* **Deployment strategy:** Blue/Green with database **expand‑migrate‑contract** pattern; feature flags (config‑driven via `APP_FEATURE_FLAGS` JSON) for risky changes.
* **Backups:** Logical (`mysqldump --single-transaction`) + physical snapshots; verify restore in staging before cutover.
* **Compatibility matrix:**

  * PHP **8.3** (OPcache, JIT off for CLI).
  * MySQL **8.0.36+** (utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci), Redis **7.x**.
  * Node **20.x** for Vite build.

### 1.2 Upgrade Steps (Scriptable)

1. **Branch:** `upgrade/laravel11-php83`.
2. **Composer core:**

   ```bash
   composer config platform.php 8.3.0
   composer require laravel/framework:^11.0 laravel/tinker --with-all-dependencies
   composer require nunomaduro/larastan:^2.9 phpstan/phpstan:^1.11 --dev
   composer require laravel/scout meilisearch/meilisearch-php --no-update
   composer update
   ```
3. **App bootstrap changes:** adopt new `bootstrap/app.php` signature; consolidate middleware to `bootstrap/app.php` pipeline per L11 conventions.
4. **Deprecations & Replacements**

   * `Str::random()` → OK; remove helper polyfills.
   * `Route::middleware()` group updates; use typed Enums for statuses/roles.
   * Replace any `SwiftMailer` remnants with Symfony Mailer (L11 default).
   * Filesystem: ensure S3 driver uses `visibility` & `temporaryUrls` correctly.
5. **Auth & Hashing**

   * Ensure **Argon2id** (`config/hashing.php`).
   * Add **WebAuthn** (Passkeys) optional package for later.
6. **Testing & Static Analysis**

   ```bash
   php artisan test --parallel
   vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=1G
   vendor/bin/larastan analyse --level=6 app database routes
   ```
7. **CI Gate** (GitHub Actions snippet)

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
           with: { php-version: '8.3', extensions: mbstring, intl, redis }
         - run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-interaction
         - run: php artisan key:generate
         - run: php artisan test --parallel
         - run: vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --no-progress
   ```
8. **Rollout:** deploy Green environment → run DB expand migrations (no drops) → warm caches → switch traffic → contract migrations.

### 1.3 Coding Standards & Modularity

* **DDD‑ish** packages: `App/Domain/*`, `App/Http/*`, `App/Support/*`.
* **Contracts & Service Providers** for cacheable read services; prohibit facades in domain layer.
* **DTOs** (spatie/laravel-data optional) for API I/O.

---

## 2) Security Baseline (Enterprise)

### 2.1 HTTP Security Headers (Nginx + Middleware)

* **Nginx snippet** (applied on all vhosts):

  ```nginx
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
  add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https:; media-src https:; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' cdn.*; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' fonts.gstatic.com; connect-src 'self' https: wss:; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'" always;
  add_header Referrer-Policy "same-origin" always;
  add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin" always;
  add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp" always;
  add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site" always;
  add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
  add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(self), microphone=(), camera=()" always;
  ```
* **Laravel middleware** to append/override and set per‑route relaxations (e.g., Stripe Checkout origins).

### 2.2 Session, CSRF, Cookies

* `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `SAMESITE=strict` for dashboard; `lax` for cross‑app needs.
* Rotate `APP_KEY` under maintenance window with re‑login policy; store secrets in **KMS** (AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault) and inject via env at deploy.

### 2.3 Authentication & Authorization

* **2FA (TOTP)** + backup codes; optional **WebAuthn**.
* **RBAC** via Policies/Gates; admin routes behind IP allowlist (+ per‑user device trust).
* Device/session management UI with remote sign‑out; session fixation protection.

### 2.4 Input & File Security

* **Form Request** validation across all write endpoints.
* **Upload pipeline:** size limits, MIME sniffing, image re‑encode (Intervention Image), **EXIF strip**, **ClamAV** scan via queue; quarantine bucket for fails.

### 2.5 Rate Limiting & Anti‑Abuse

* Redis‑backed throttle: **auth**, **register**, **password reset**, **post/comment/like**.
* Abuse scoring (heuristics) → temp blocks; bot‑detection hooks (hCaptcha optional).

### 2.6 Secrets & Keys

* **No secrets in Git.** `.env` template only. CI pulls from secret manager.
* Rotate Stripe webhooks & API keys quarterly; audit with checklist.

### 2.7 Compliance & Data Protection

* PII field‑level encryption where feasible; right‑to‑erasure tooling; export (GDPR Art. 20) jobs.
* Audit log for admin actions (immutable store / WORM S3 bucket).

### 2.8 Security Testing

* **SAST:** Larastan/PHPStan, Trivy on container images.
* **DAST:** OWASP ZAP baseline weekly against staging.
* **Dependency** alerts enabled; monthly patch window.

### 2.9 Incident Response

* Playbook: detection → triage (SEV levels) → containment (revoke keys, disable routes) → comms templates → post‑mortem with action items.

---

## 3) Performance (Web, API, Queues)

### 3.1 Caching Strategy

* **Config/Route/View cache** at build; cache‑busting on deploy.
* **Query caching** via repository layer + tagged Redis caches (`community:*, profile:*`). TTLs + cache stampedes avoided with locks.
* **HTTP caching** for public community pages: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=120` via middleware.

### 3.2 Redis & Horizon

* Dedicated Redis DBs: `app`, `cache`, `horizon`, `broadcasting`.
* Horizon queues: `notifications`, `media`, `webhooks`, `search-index` with concurrency maps; auto‑scaling workers based on queue depth.

### 3.3 Octane (Optional)

* Enable for API nodes; warm singletons; guard against request‑leaks (no per‑request state in singletons). Fallback to FPM for admin if needed.

### 3.4 Database Performance

* MySQL config: `innodb_buffer_pool_size` ≥ 60% RAM; `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1`; slow query log with pt‑query‑digest.
* Add **partial indexes** for feed queries (`created_at DESC`, `like_count DESC`).
* Use **READ COMMITTED** isolation; avoid N+1 with eager loads; paginate with **keyset pagination** for infinite feeds.

### 3.5 Media & CDN

* S3 + CloudFront (or equivalent) for images/video; presigned uploads; background transcode.
* Image sizes responsive (AVIF/WebP); lazy loading.

### 3.6 Page Performance (Vite)

* Code‑split community pages; prefetch critical routes; purge unused CSS; inline critical CSS for top pages.

### 3.7 Load & Stress Testing

* k6 scripts for feed, post create, notifications; targets: **p95 < 250ms** API, **TTFB < 200ms** for cached public pages at 500 RPS.

### 3.8 Rollback & Recovery

* Cache clear & route rollback scripts; ability to disable Octane; feature‑flag kill‑switch for heavy endpoints.

---

### Deliverables in this Tranche

* Upgrade PR with passing CI on PHP 8.3 & L11.
* Nginx + middleware security headers, rate‑limiters, ClamAV pipeline.
* Redis/Horizon tuned config, cache layers, HTTP cache middleware.
* k6 load scripts & baseline results.
* Runbooks: Key rotation, incident response, rollback, cache warmup.

# Sections 1–3 — Enterprise, Modular Upgrade for Communities

Scope in this tranche: **(1) Data Model & DB Migrations**, **(2) Backend Domain/Services & API**, **(3) Frontend Web UI/UX**. All content aligns with Laravel 11/PHP 8.3 foundation and the security/performance baselines from the previous tranche.

---

## 1) Data Model & Database Migrations (Communities & Social)

### 1.1 Naming & Conventions

* **Schema name:** default (MySQL). Table names snake_case plural. PK `id BIGINT UNSIGNED`.
* Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`; soft deletes only where moderation requires recovery.
* Multi-tenancy (optional): add `tenant_id` to community‑bound tables if needed later; guard via global scopes.

* **Feed queries:** composite index `(community_id, is_pinned DESC, created_at DESC)`; consider partial index `is_pinned=1` (via generated col) if needed.
* **Hot counters:** keep `like_count`, `comment_count` denormalized; update via atomic `increment` and reconcile via nightly job.
* **Partitioning:** optional monthly partitions on `community_posts` for very large datasets; archive old posts to cold storage.

### 1.4 FKs & On‑Delete Behavior

* Communities cannot be hard‑deleted if members/posts exist; use **soft delete** + archival job.
* `post_id` cascade deletes comments/likes to avoid orphans.

### 1.5 Migrations (Laravel examples)

## 3) Frontend (Web) — UI/UX & Components

### 3.1 Tech & Architecture

* **Stack:** Vite + Vue 3 or React 18; Tailwind + shadcn/ui; Typesafe API client (openapi‑typescript or zodios); State via Pinia/Zustand; Realtime via Pusher/Laravel WebSockets.
* **Routing:** `/communities`, `/c/{slug}`, `/c/{slug}/members`, `/c/{slug}/leaderboard`, `/c/{slug}/calendar`, `/c/{slug}/settings`.
* **Access:** Guard routes with policy hints from `/me/capabilities` endpoint to minimize 403s.

### 3.2 Components (atoms → organisms)

* **Atoms:** Avatar, LevelBadge, RolePill, LikeButton, MentionText, TimeAgo, OnlineDot.
* **Molecules:** PostCard, CommentThread, MemberRow, TierCard, MapPanel, CalendarWidget, NotificationBell, ComposerBar.
* **Organisms:** CommunityHeader (banner/avatar/tags/actions), CommunityFeed (virtualized), MembersList (infinite scroll + filters), AdminPanel (tabs: Moderation/Levels/Points/Paywalls/Geo/Settings), SearchResultGrid.

### 3.3 UX Flows

* **Join/Subscribe:** CTA decides `join` vs `request` vs `subscribe`. Show tier modal, then Stripe Checkout; on success, entitlement revalidation and paywall unlock.
* **Compose:** floating composer in feed; drag‑drop media; visibility selector; markdown/preview; scheduled posts.
* **Moderation:** inline actions (pin/lock/hide/ban); bulk actions from AdminPanel; reason codes.
* **Notifications:** bell badge, panel with tabs (All, Mentions, System), mark‑read; deep links to post/comment.
* **Members:** filters (admins/mods/online/newest); roles badges; joined date; follow/unfollow.
* **Leaderboards:** tabs for Daily/Weekly/Monthly/All‑time; rank, points, delta; progress to next level.
* **Geo:** map bounds display; places list; privacy toggle; click to filter posts near place (optional).

### 3.4 Accessibility & Internationalization

* All interactive elements ≥44px; focus states; ARIA live regions for feed updates.
* RTL support; i18n strings with ICU; date/time localization.

### 3.5 Performance

* Virtualized lists for feeds & members; media lazy load; responsive image `srcset`; code splitting per route; HTTP caching for public pages.

### 3.6 Error States

* Empty feeds with smart starters ("Write something…"); network retries with toasts; 403 explanatory banners ("Requires membership/tier").

### 3.7 Admin Dashboard (Web)

* Tabs: **Moderation**, **Members**, **Levels**, **Points Rules**, **Paywalls/Tiers**, **Revenue**, **Geo**, **Settings**.

# Sections 10–12 — Enterprise, Modular Upgrade

Scope: **(10) DevOps & Environments**, **(11) Migration & Backfill Plan**, **(12) Testing Strategy**.

---

## 10) DevOps & Environments

### 10.1 Nginx & Networking

* **Vhost baseline**

  * TLS (Let's Encrypt/ACME) with OCSP stapling; HTTP/2 + ALPN; HSTS preload.
  * **Security headers** (from foundation tranche) via `include security-headers.conf`.
  * **Compression**: gzip on dynamic; **brotli** for static with `brotli_comp_level 5`.
  * **Caching**: `Cache-Control` for static assets (1y immutable) and public community pages (60s SWR 120s).
  * **WebSockets upstream** for Laravel WebSockets/Pusher compatible:

    ```nginx
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade { default upgrade; '' close; }
    server {
      location /app { try_files $uri /index.php?$query_string; }
      location /ws/ {
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_pass http://websockets:6001;
      }
    }
    ```

### 10.2 Queues & Workers

* **Horizon** with queue segmentation: `notifications`, `media`, `webhooks`, `search-index`, `emails`.
* **Supervision**: systemd unit templates per worker group; autoscale on queue depth; graceful shutdown on deploy.
* **Reserved, retry, timeout** tuned per queue (e.g., media 300s timeout, retries 2; notifications 30s, retries 3).

### 10.3 Storage & Lifecycle

* **S3 buckets**: `academy-community-media`, `academy-avatars`, `academy-banners` with separate KMS keys.
* **Lifecycle**: move originals to IA after 30d; delete transcode intermediates after 7d; retain thumbnails indefinitely.
* **S3 Object‑Lock (WORM)** for audit logs bucket.

### 10.4 CI/CD Pipelines

* **Stages**: Lint → Unit → Feature → Dusk E2E (staging ephemeral) → Build Flutter (Android/iOS) → Push to TestFlight/Play Internal → Gate → Prod deploy.
* **Example GitHub Actions matrix** (excerpt):

  ```yaml
  jobs:
    backend:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
          with: { php-version: '8.3', extensions: mbstring, intl, redis }
        - run: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
        - run: php artisan test --parallel
        - run: vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
    flutter:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
          with: { flutter-version: '3.24.0' }
        - run: flutter pub get
        - run: flutter test
        - run: flutter build appbundle --flavor staging
        - run: flutter build ipa --export-options-plist ios/ExportOptions.plist
  ```
* **Env promotion gates**: require passing tests, security scan, manual approval, and Sentry error budget within limits.

### 10.5 Secrets Management

* `.env` only as template. Real secrets from **AWS SSM Parameter Store** or **HashiCorp Vault** at deploy.
* Keys required: **Stripe**, **FCM**, **Mapbox**, **Meili**, **WebSockets**, **S3**, **DB**, **Sentry**.
* Rotation policy: quarterly; emergency rotation playbook.

### 10.6 Observability & Alerts (tie‑in)

* Logs to centralized stack (ELK/CloudWatch); metrics (Prometheus) for queues, HTTP p95, DB; alerts on error rate, queue lag, 5xx spikes, disk near full, Redis memory.

---

## 11) Migration & Backfill Plan

### 11.1 Strategy

* **Feature flags** to hide UI/API routes until data is ready.
* **Expand → Migrate → Contract** pattern for any model changes that touch existing tables.

### 11.2 Steps

1. **Ship migrations** (new community tables) behind flags; run in staging, then prod maintenance window.
2. **Seed**: categories, base levels, default points rules.
3. **Backfill memberships**: optional rule to infer community membership from **classroom enrollments**; script uses batches of 1,000 with retry and idempotency keys.
4. **Incremental rollout**: enable a **beta community** for internal users; monitor Sentry/Horizon; gather performance metrics.
5. **Legacy profile → activity**: ETL scripts to create `profile_activity` rows (posts, comments, course completions) to populate contributions tab.

### 11.3 Scripts (outline)

* `artisan community:seed-baseline`
* `artisan community:backfill-membership --source=classrooms --batch=1000`
* `artisan community:migrate-legacy-activity --dry-run`
* `artisan community:enable-feature --flag=communities`

### 11.4 Rollback Plan

* Disable feature flag; stop writers; revert last migration batch if no data loss; preserve S3 media.

---

## 12) Testing Strategy

### 12.1 Unit Tests

* Services: `PointsServiceTest`, `LeaderboardServiceTest`, `SubscriptionServiceTest`, `MembershipServiceTest`, `PermissionsPolicyTest`.
* Pure logic verified with table‑driven datasets.

### 12.2 Feature Tests

* API auth, community CRUD, feed visibility (public/community/paid), paywall enforcement, rate limiting, Stripe webhook handling (signed payloads), notifications delivery.

### 12.3 E2E (Dusk/Playwright)

* Scenarios: join/subscribe → compose (text+image) → like/comment → notification → leaderboard update → paywall view.
* Calendar and classroom link flows validated (create event → ICS export → reminder push).

### 12.4 Load & Resilience (k6)

* Feed read 500 RPS, write 100 RPS; target API p95 < 250ms.
* Websocket fan‑out test: 5k concurrent clients, 1 msg/sec broadcast; ensure CPU < 70% and message delivery < 2s.

### 12.5 Security Testing

* SAST (Larastan/PHPStan), Composer audit; OWASP ZAP baseline; dependency patch cadence.

### 12.6 CI Gates & Coverage

* Coverage thresholds: backend 80% lines/branches on services; UI critical path tests green.
* Build fails on failing gates; artifact uploads for test reports and coverage badges.

### 12.7 Test Data & Fixtures

* Factories & seeders for communities, tiers, posts, comments; S3 mock for media; Stripe test keys.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Nginx/WebSockets configured; Horizon workers autoscale; S3 buckets with lifecycle and KMS; secrets injected from SSM/Vault.
2. Feature flags allow safe rollout; baseline seeders run; membership backfill works and idempotent; beta rollout executed.

## 18) Rollout Plan (Web + Mobile)

**Phase 1 – Backend APIs + Web Admin (internal beta)**

* Ship DB + services behind flags; admin panel (moderation, levels/points) available to staff only.
* QA: unit/feature tests green; staging data load; k6 baseline; Sentry zero new criticals.

**Phase 2 – Web user feed & composer (limited community)**

* Enable communities for internal pilot group; collect UX telemetry; iterate on feed performance & moderation.

**Phase 3 – Flutter beta (TestFlight/Play Internal)**

* Ship Communities Home/Detail/Feed/Composer; push notifications + deep links.
* Closed testers (12) invited; crash‑free users ≥ 98% target.

**Phase 4 – Payments & paywalls enabled**

* Stripe live keys; tiers/single‑purchase; entitlement checks; reconcile webhooks.
* Marketing warm‑up; docs for creators/community admins.

**Phase 5 – Full release + monitoring & A/B tests**

* Turn on feature flags for all; add tutorials/guides; A/B test feed ranking & points rules; watch MRR, retention, and content creation rates.

**Cutover Guardrails**

* Rollback plan documented; feature kill‑switches; error budget alarms; capacity headroom ≥30%; SLOs: API p95 < 250ms, WS delivery < 2s,

---

## 19) Risks & Mitigations

* **Scale spikes** → Autoscale workers; CDN for media; paginate aggressively.
* **Abuse** → Moderation tools, rate limits, shadow bans.
* **Payments disputes** → Clear refund policy; webhook reconciliation jobs.
* **App store reviews** → Clear feature flags; staged rollout; crashlytics.

---

## 20) Documentation & Handover

* API reference (OpenAPI); ERD; runbooks (alerts, webhooks, queue backlog, websocket down); admin guides; community manager SOPs; security checklist.

---

**Deliverables:** code, migrations, seeders, tests, CI/CD pipelines, Flutter screens & components, icon sets, email/push templates, admin dashboards, monitoring dashboards, runbooks.

## Completion Workflow & Visualization Guidance
1. **Orient the team:** Review the entire scope above, aligning domain leads (backend, frontend, mobile, security, analytics, DevOps) to their corresponding sections so ownership is clear before execution.
2. **Visual planning:** Translate the task list below into a shared kanban or roadmap board with swimlanes per section number; use color coding to map Functionality, Integration, UI/UX, and Security scores for quick status heatmaps.
3. **Progress tracking:** During implementation, update each checkbox when deliverables meet acceptance criteria, and fill the four grading boxes (0–100%) based on QA, integration tests, UX reviews, and security validations.
4. **Review cadence:** Schedule cross-functional reviews at the completion of each numbered cluster (e.g., Sections 0–3, 4–6) to reassess risks, adjust grades, and confirm dependencies remain unblocked.
5. **Completion proof:** Archive evidence (test reports, design mocks, rollout logs) alongside the grades to provide traceability for compliance, audits, and stakeholder sign-off.

## Current Codebase State

### Repository layout
- **Web application** lives under `Web_Application/Academy-LMS` and is a monolithic Laravel 11 project that still reflects the legacy Academy LMS course-centric domain. Its structure relies on large controller directories (for example `app/Http/Controllers/frontend`, `app/Http/Controllers/Admin`, `app/Http/Controllers/student`) and an extensive list of Eloquent models covering courses, assignments, payments, bootcamps, etc., but there is no modular separation for communities, membership tiers, or social feeds.
- **Student mobile app** under `Student Mobile APP/academy_lms_app` is a Flutter 3 project configured with `provider`, `http`, and basic local `sqflite` helpers. It targets the same course catalog flows as the legacy LMS and does not implement the Riverpod-based architecture, background tasks, or realtime features described in the upgrade scope.
- The repo also carries historical update packs and installation SQL inside `Web_Application/Academy-LMS/upload`, indicating reliance on manual patching rather than automated migrations or CI pipelines.

### Section 1 – Domain & Data Foundations
- Database migrations (`database/migrations`) create tables for courses, categories, lessons, quizzes, payments, etc. There are no schemas for communities, levels, points, leaderboards, geo-feeds, or paywall tiers. Seeders focus on LMS defaults; no staged community data or large dataset performance tooling exists.
- Models in `app/Models` mirror the LMS focus (Course, Enrollment, Lesson, Quiz, Wishlist, etc.) with no domain objects for communities, memberships, feed posts, comments, follows, or device registrations.
- Helpers like `app/Helpers/Common_helper.php` still power global queries and view composers, showing absence of a domain-driven service layer expected by the upgrade.

### Section 2 – Backend Services & APIs
- `routes/api.php` exposes Sanctum-protected endpoints strictly for LMS flows (login, signup, categories, wishlist, cart, course progress, Zoom meetings). There are no controllers or resources for community feeds, notifications, leaderboard, geo features, or subscription tiers.
- Policy, rate-limiting, and request validation are minimal. API controllers return arrays/json directly without Resources/DTO layering, and there is no OpenAPI generation or versioning strategy.
- Background jobs/queues are limited to legacy Laravel defaults; no dedicated services exist for points accrual, paywall enforcement, or realtime event broadcasting.

### Section 3 – Web Experience & Admin
- Frontend views are Blade templates under `resources/views/frontend/default` with jQuery-era partials and CSS from `public/assets`. There is no componentized SPA, virtualized feed, notification bell, or responsive design tokens aligning to the new design system.
- Admin dashboards in `resources/views/admin` cover LMS activities (courses, instructors, students, earnings) but lack the prescribed Moderation, Members, Levels, Points Rules, Paywalls/Tiers, Revenue, Geo, or Settings tabs. Analytics charts are absent; only static tables/forms are present.
- Internationalization is handled via custom helpers (`get_phrase`) reading from database tables, not ICU message catalogs; RTL/layout tokens are not defined.

### Section 4 – Mobile App Status
- The Flutter app keeps a provider-based state management approach (`lib/providers`) and imperative networking via `http`. There is no Riverpod, Dio/Retrofit stack, nor generated models via `freezed`/`json_serializable` despite the package being listed.
- Offline features are limited to a bespoke `sqflite` cache for downloaded videos (`DatabaseHelper`). There is no Hive-backed feed cache, background sync, or retry queue.
- Realtime presence, push notifications, deep links, maps, Stripe mobile flows, and device registration APIs are absent. Authentication persists tokens in `shared_preferences` without secure storage or refresh handling.
- Screen coverage (`lib/screens`) targets catalog browsing, course playback, wishlist, cart, and profile settings. Community feeds, leaderboards, subscription tiers, notifications center, or geo/classroom tabs do not exist.

### Sections 5 & 10 – Security, Infrastructure, and Operations
- Middleware focuses on legacy auth/role checks; there is no evidence of enhanced security headers, device trust, audit trails, abuse mitigation, or secrets management beyond `.env` defaults.
- File uploads rely on Intervention Image and manual validation; antivirus scanning, signed URL expirations, and storage lifecycle policies are not implemented.
- There are no infrastructure-as-code manifests, CI/CD pipelines, or automated deployment scripts in the repository. Installation relies on manual steps documented in `upload` packages.

### Sections 6 & 7 – Analytics and Admin Enhancements
- There is no analytics instrumentation, event taxonomy, or batching (neither in Laravel nor Flutter). No dashboards, charts, or retention metrics exist in the admin panel.
- Role management remains basic (admin, instructor, student) without RBAC matrices, audit logging, or scheduled digests/automation jobs (leaderboard recalculations, etc.).

### Section 8 – Search
- Search functionality is limited to controller methods querying MySQL directly; no Meilisearch/OpenSearch integration, synonym management, or typeahead UI is present.

### Section 9 – Messaging & Notifications
- Notifications are handled through database/email templates under `resources/views/email`, but there is no modular messaging pipeline, provider abstraction, segmentation, or push notification support.
- User preference management for notifications is minimal; unsubscribe flows rely on manual toggles without policy-backed enforcement.

### Sections 11–18 – Migration, Testing, and Governance
- Beyond basic migration files, there are no migration plans, expand/contract strategies, or rollback automation documented in code.
- Automated testing is nearly empty: only Laravel stub tests (`tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`, `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`, `ProfileTest.php`) and the default Flutter `widget_test.dart` exist. There are no feature, E2E, load, or security tests.
- No QA tooling (Pest, Playwright, k6, etc.), coverage enforcement, or fixture management is configured.
- Documentation centers on installation guides; there are no runbooks, SOPs, or governance artifacts for analytics, privacy, or rollout guardrails.

### Overall readiness assessment
- The current stack delivers an LMS-oriented product rather than the community-centric experience detailed in the upgrade roadmap. Major foundational work is required across backend domain modeling, API surface, frontend/mobile experiences, security, analytics, and DevOps before the upgrade acceptance criteria can be met.

## Comprehensive Codebase Assessment (2024-XX)

### Architectural Overview & Repository Hygiene
- Mono-repo houses a Laravel 11 monolith (`Web_Application/Academy-LMS`), a legacy Flutter 3 mobile client (`Student Mobile APP/academy_lms_app`), infrastructure notes, and tooling scripts. Projects live side by side without shared packages or workspaces, so no code reuse or contract enforcement between back end, web front end, and mobile.
- Git history includes numerous vendor drops ("Update pack" zips, SQL dumps) and lacks automation hooks (no CI workflows, git hooks, or formatting configs). Secret management relies on `.env` scaffolds checked into source control.
- Documentation (`docs`, `Documentation`) focuses on installation and changelog snippets; there are no architecture decision records, runbooks, or environment diagrams.

### Backend (Laravel 11) – Domain, Services, and APIs
- Domain models remain LMS-centric: courses, lessons, quizzes, bundles, certificates, payments. No Eloquent models or migrations exist for communities, social feeds, leaderboards, geo features, or paywall tiers, so core upgrade features are missing at the schema layer.
- Controllers are grouped by audience (`frontend`, `Admin`, `student`) and use God-class patterns with mixed responsibilities (validation, querying, response shaping). There is no service layer, repository abstraction, or command bus; business logic lives directly in controllers and helper functions (`app/Helper`).
- API surface is thin (`routes/api.php`): endpoints support login, registration, catalog browsing, purchase flows, Zoom meetings, and profile updates. There are no versioned APIs, transformers/resources, OpenAPI specs, or client SDK generation.
- Authentication uses Laravel Sanctum with basic token issuing. There is no multi-factor auth, device/session management, or OAuth2/OIDC integration. Authorization relies on legacy role checks (`role_id`, `user_type`) with minimal policy coverage.
- Background processing is limited to Laravel queues for email and standard jobs; no scheduled tasks exist for analytics aggregation, leaderboard scoring, or notifications.
- Observability and error handling: logging uses default Monolog stack without structured context; no tracing, metrics, or centralized audit logs are configured.

### Database, Seeders, and Data Lifecycle
- Migration set stops at LMS tables; numerous tables are created via raw SQL imports inside `upload` packages, signalling drift between code and production schemas.
- Seeders provide starter content for courses/categories but do not cover community data, tier definitions, or analytics fixtures. Factories largely unused; no large synthetic dataset generation for performance testing.
- There is no migration versioning strategy, expand/contract playbooks, or automated rollback scripts. Backup/restore procedures are undocumented.

### Web Front End (Blade)
- UI built with Blade templates and jQuery scripts stored in `public/assets/frontend`. Styling mixes Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS; there is no component library, design tokens, or responsive grid aligned to new product requirements.
- Pages delivered server-side only; no SPA routing, state management, or real-time updates. Feeds, notifications, leaderboards, maps, and chat experiences are absent.
- Accessibility, localization, and theming rely on bespoke helpers pulling phrases from the database. There is no ICU message format, RTL strategy, or dynamic locale packs.

### Student Mobile App (Flutter)
- Flutter app targets Dart SDK >=3.2.0 but retains `provider` and manual `http` usage rather than the prescribed Riverpod + Dio/Retrofit stack. Packages for `freezed`/`json_serializable` are present but models remain manually written.
- Screens cover login, catalog browsing, video playback, wishlist, cart, and profile. There is no implementation of community discovery, feed consumption/composition, notifications center, leaderboards, calendar, map integration, or subscription tiers.
- State persists via `shared_preferences` and a local `sqflite` helper for downloaded media; no offline-first caching, background sync, or retry queues. Push notifications, deep links, and analytics instrumentation are unimplemented.
- Build tooling lacks flavor-based configs, Fastlane scripts, or CI automation. Platform-specific integrations (Stripe, Maps, Firebase) are absent.

### Security Posture
- Middleware stack applies standard CSRF, auth, and rate limiting but omits hardened headers, CSP, COOP/COEP, and permissions policies (tests exist but corresponding middleware is not wired globally). HTTPS enforcement, security.txt, and bot mitigation are missing.
- Password hashing uses Laravel defaults (bcrypt) without Argon2id upgrade; 2FA, WebAuthn, and passwordless flows are not implemented. Session/device management is minimal.
- File uploads rely on Intervention Image and basic MIME checking; no antivirus scanning, EXIF stripping, or signed URL lifecycle controls. Payment processing integrates with legacy gateways; Stripe Checkout and webhook hardening for subscription tiers are missing.
- Sensitive data encryption at rest, secrets rotation, audit trails, and compliance tooling (GDPR/CCPA workflows) are not present.

### Infrastructure, DevOps, and Testing
- No IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation) or container orchestration manifests exist. Deployment documented as manual (FTP/CPANEL-style) through update packs.
- CI/CD pipelines are absent; there are no GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines, or automated testing scripts. Build artifacts and environment promotion steps are manual.
- Automated testing coverage is sparse: Laravel project contains a handful of example feature/unit tests and security header stubs; Flutter project only includes the default widget test. There are no integration, contract, E2E, load, or security tests.
- Static analysis (PHPStan/Psalm, Dart analysis), linting, and formatting enforcement are not configured.

### Analytics, Messaging, and Integrations
- No analytics SDKs or server-side event tracking present. Admin dashboards lack cohort, retention, or monetization charts.
- Messaging relies on Laravel notifications/email templates only. Push, SMS, in-app messaging, and segmentation pipelines are unimplemented.
- Search remains MySQL-based with `LIKE` queries; no external search engine integration or synonym/typo handling.

### Completeness vs. Upgrade Goals
- Core LMS flows remain functional, but community-centric upgrade requirements (Sections 1–20) are largely unaddressed across schema, services, UI, security, analytics, and operations.
- Estimated readiness: <20% of targeted scope delivered. Foundational work (data modeling, API design, modular UI, mobile architecture, security hardening, observability, testing, and DevOps) must be established before feature development can proceed.
- Significant refactoring and platform investments are required: introduce modular domain boundaries, design event-driven services, adopt modern front-end/mobile stacks, implement security/compliance controls, and build CI/CD plus testing infrastructure.
