# Runtime Screenshots

Automated screenshots captured via `tools/screenshots/capture_symfony.sh` should
be stored in this directory. Use descriptive filenames or rely on the
timestamp-based naming generated by the helper script. Each screenshot documents
the state of the application at the time of capture.
