# Upgrade Program Progress Tracker

This tracker summarizes delivery status against the upgrade tranches documented in `AGENTS.md`. It records execution quality and completion confidence for recent stages.

## Stage 6 – Analytics & Tracking (Previous)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Analytics instrumentation (web/mobile) | 100% | 100% | Server-side lifecycle events persisted with retention policies; mobile app streams consent-aware analytics via Firebase. |
| Data governance & consent | 100% | 100% | Consent workflow exposed via API, pseudonymized hashes stored, and retention pruning automated. |
| Reporting surfaces | 100% | 100% | Admin dashboards surface community KPIs, cohort retention, and export tooling for analytics consumers. |
| Automated QA coverage | 100% | 100% | Feature tests exercise analytics dispatch and consent endpoints ensuring regression safety. |
| **Overall Stage 6** | **100%** | **100%** | Analytics tranche completed with production-grade telemetry, governance, and validation. |

## Stage 7 – Admin & Ops (Complete)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Admin automation jobs (archive, welcome, health) | 100% | 100% | Auto-archive scheduler, welcome DM queue, and health monitor webhook alerts are live with configurable thresholds and incident logging. |
| Admin metrics & dashboards | 100% | 100% | Vue-powered admin control center ships overview/detail tabs, CSV exports, realtime KPI tiles, and deep moderation tooling. |
| Workflow enforcement & audit | 100% | 100% | Immutable audit logging middleware, granular role policies, and paywall enforcement guardrails cover all admin actions. |
| Mobile parity (moderation visibility) | 100% | 100% | Flutter client surfaces moderation queue actions, geo tooling, and leaderboard parity backed by the same APIs as web. |
| **Overall Stage 7** | **100%** | **100%** | Admin and operations tranche delivers production-grade dashboards, governance, automations, and cross-platform parity. |

## Stage 8 – Search (Complete)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engine & index configuration | 100% | 100% | Meilisearch indexes (communities, posts, members, comments) tuned with ranking, facets, and synonyms driven by config. |
| Ingestion & sync pipeline | 100% | 100% | Streamed data sources, queue-backed ingestion jobs, and CDC traits keep indexes fresh with operational commands. |
| Query experience (web & mobile) | 100% | 100% | Unified search UI delivers fuzzy chips, highlights, saved queries, and infinite scroll across admin SPA and Flutter client. |
| Permissions & governance | 100% | 100% | Signed visibility tokens, paywall-aware filters, and saved-search audit APIs enforce privacy and export controls. |
| **Overall Stage 8** | **100%** | **100%** | Search tranche achieves enterprise-grade discovery with resilient ingestion and governed cross-platform UX. |

## Quality Checks

- Feature, unit, and API tests validate admin automations, search ingestion, and visibility contracts across web and mobile.
- Mobile parity confirmed: moderation actions, search facets, and analytics instrumentation align with web behaviours.
- Operational monitors (queue health, moderation depth, ingestion failures) emit actionable alerts with webhook escalations.

Progress percentages are calibrated against enterprise acceptance criteria in `AGENTS.md` and will be re-evaluated after each milestone.
