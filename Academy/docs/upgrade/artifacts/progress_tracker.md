| Query experience (web & mobile) | 100% | 100% | Unified search UI delivers fuzzy chips, highlights, saved queries, and infinite scroll across admin SPA and Flutter client. |
| Permissions & governance | 100% | 100% | Signed visibility tokens, paywall-aware filters, and saved-search audit APIs enforce privacy and export controls. |
| **Overall Stage 8** | **100%** | **100%** | Search tranche achieves enterprise-grade discovery with resilient ingestion and governed cross-platform UX. |

## Stage 9 – Email & Push Messaging (Complete)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Templates & localization | 100% | 100% | MJML/Blade templates render localized community events, digests, and transactional notices with themable assets. |
| Delivery pipeline & providers | 100% | 100% | Resilient mail channel orchestrates SES→Resend→SMTP fallback with circuit breakers and provider health telemetry. |
| Digests & preference center | 100% | 100% | Daily/weekly digests, per-community notification controls, and mobile/web preference UIs ship with density controls. |
| Monitoring, webhooks & suppressions | 100% | 100% | Bounce/complaint webhooks auto-suppress addresses, log deliverability metrics, and expose provider health dashboards. |
| **Overall Stage 9** | **100%** | **100%** | Messaging tranche delivers production-grade email/push, governance, analytics, and user-centric controls across platforms. |

## Stage 10 – DevOps & Environments (Complete)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nginx networking & security hardening | 100% | 100% | Brotli/gzip compression, SWR cache controls, websocket upgrades, and ModSecurity-ready vhost shipped via `infra/nginx/academy_communities.conf`. |
| Horizon queues & worker orchestration | 100% | 100% | Horizon systemd templates, autoscaling Artisan command, and environment file management keep queue concurrency aligned with backlog telemetry. |
| Storage lifecycle & WORM compliance | 100% | 100% | Terraform module provisions media/avatars/banners/audit buckets with lifecycle transitions, SSE-KMS, and object-lock retention. |
| CI/CD pipeline & secrets governance | 100% | 100% | GitHub Actions adds Dusk E2E gate, production packaging stage, and release artifact bundling with hardened deploy script consuming managed secrets. |
| **Overall Stage 10** | **100%** | **100%** | DevOps tranche delivers hardened edge config, autoscaled workers, governed storage, and CI/CD promotion gates ready for production rollout. |

## Quality Checks

- Feature, unit, and API tests validate admin automations, search ingestion, and visibility contracts across web and mobile.
- Mobile parity confirmed: moderation actions, search facets, and analytics instrumentation align with web behaviours.
- Operational monitors (queue health, moderation depth, ingestion failures) emit actionable alerts with webhook escalations.
- Deliverability telemetry validated: resilient mail channel, suppression store, and webhook ingestion covered by automated tests.
- GitHub Actions pipeline enforces lint/unit/static analysis, Dusk browser E2E, Flutter builds, and gated production packaging before deployment approvals.
- Queue autoscaler exercises Horizon supervisors via systemd reloads, ensuring backlog thresholds trigger deterministic scaling.

Progress percentages are calibrated against enterprise acceptance criteria in `AGENTS.md` and will be re-evaluated after each milestone.
