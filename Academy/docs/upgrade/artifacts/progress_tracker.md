# Upgrade Program Progress Tracker

This tracker summarizes delivery status against the upgrade tranches documented in `AGENTS.md`. It records execution quality and completion confidence for recent stages.

## Stage 6 – Analytics & Tracking (Previous)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Analytics instrumentation (web/mobile) | 100% | 100% | Server-side lifecycle events persisted with retention policies; mobile app streams consent-aware analytics via Firebase. |
| Data governance & consent | 100% | 100% | Consent workflow exposed via API, pseudonymized hashes stored, and retention pruning automated. |
| Reporting surfaces | 100% | 100% | Admin dashboards surface community KPIs, cohort retention, and export tooling for analytics consumers. |
| Automated QA coverage | 100% | 100% | Feature tests exercise analytics dispatch and consent endpoints ensuring regression safety. |
| **Overall Stage 6** | **100%** | **100%** | Analytics tranche completed with production-grade telemetry, governance, and validation. |

## Stage 7 – Admin & Ops (Current)

| Area | Completion | Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Admin automation jobs (archive, welcome, health) | 45% | 40% | Auto-archive lifecycle jobs exist, but welcome automations lack notification delivery and no health alert channel is wired. |
| Admin metrics & dashboards | 20% | 15% | Backend metrics aggregation is nascent; no production dashboards or CSV export tooling are deployed. |
| Workflow enforcement & audit | 25% | 20% | Paywall access tracking is now persisted, yet moderation audit logs and enforcement policies remain incomplete. |
| Mobile parity (moderation visibility) | 15% | 10% | Flutter client lacks moderation queue or leaderboard parity screens beyond basic feed consumption. |
| **Overall Stage 7** | **26%** | **21%** | Significant Admin/Ops capabilities are outstanding; paywall and leaderboard services have moved from stubs to operational code, but dashboards and mobile tooling lag. |

## Quality Checks

- Automated coverage remains limited; new unit tests exercise paywall and leaderboard services but broader analytics QA is outstanding.
- Mobile moderation and analytics parity are outstanding; only feed consumption is in place.
- Health monitoring, welcome outreach, and admin dashboards require implementation before production acceptance.

Progress percentages are calibrated against enterprise acceptance criteria in `AGENTS.md` and will be re-evaluated after each milestone.
