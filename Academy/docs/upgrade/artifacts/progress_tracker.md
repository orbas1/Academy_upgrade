## Quality Checks

- Feature, unit, and API tests validate admin automations, search ingestion, and visibility contracts across web and mobile.
- Mobile parity confirmed: moderation actions, search facets, and analytics instrumentation align with web behaviours.
- Operational monitors (queue health, moderation depth, ingestion failures) emit actionable alerts with webhook escalations.
- Deliverability telemetry validated: resilient mail channel, suppression store, and webhook ingestion covered by automated tests.
- GitHub Actions pipeline enforces lint/unit/static analysis, Dusk browser E2E, Flutter builds, and gated production packaging before deployment approvals.
- Queue autoscaler exercises Horizon supervisors via systemd reloads, ensuring backlog thresholds trigger deterministic scaling.
- Profile activity API gated behind feature flags; Flutter account screen surfaces recent contributions fed by the new migration pipeline.

Progress percentages are calibrated against enterprise acceptance criteria in `AGENTS.md` and will be re-evaluated after each milestone.
