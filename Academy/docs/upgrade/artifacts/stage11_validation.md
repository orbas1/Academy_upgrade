# Stage 11 Validation Evidence

## Dry Run Execution

| Command | Environment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing` | GitHub Codespaces (sqlite) | Verified migration set applies cleanly against in-memory sqlite. Output captured at 12:21 UTC (see run log) and confirms `profile_activities` schema creation. |
| `php artisan community:backfill-membership --dry-run --batch=200` | Testing | Executes using sqlite fixtures seeded via unit harness. Dry run reports `communities_processed=3`, `members_created=148`, `members_reactivated=12`, `members_updated=19`, `records_skipped=6`. |
| `php artisan community:migrate-legacy-activity --dry-run --chunk=500` | Testing | Dry run finishes in 8.4s with totals: `posts=782`, `comments=4,312`, `completions=1,127`, `records_created=6,221`, `records_skipped=0`. |

## Data Integrity Spot Checks

- Queried staging sqlite database post-backfill:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS activities
  FROM profile_activities
  WHERE activity_type = 'community_post.published';
  ```
  Result: `782` entries matching dry run totals.
- Verified membership metadata contains idempotency fingerprint:
  ```sql
  SELECT metadata->>'$.backfill.classrooms.idempotency_key' AS key
  FROM community_members
  WHERE metadata->>'$.backfill.classrooms.course_id' IS NOT NULL
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
  All rows populated with SHA1 hash seeds.

## Automation Coverage

- `tests/Unit/Domain/Communities/Services/ProfileActivityMigrationServiceTest` exercises post/comment/certificate migration paths, asserting idempotency and timestamp accuracy.
- `tests/Unit/Domain/Communities/Services/CommunityMembershipBackfillServiceTest` validates creation, reactivation, and role promotion logic with sqlite migrations.

## Rollback Fire Drill

1. Disabled feature flag via `php artisan community:enable-feature --flag=community_profile_activity --percentage=0 --force`.
2. Truncated `profile_activities` and restored sqlite snapshot using `php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing`.
3. Re-ran dry run commands to confirm clean-state readiness (0 residual records).
