# Orbas Learn Mobile Client

This Flutter project delivers the Orbas Learn student experience. It integrates
with the Laravel API located in `../../Web_Application/Academy-LMS` and consumes
the same authentication and subscription flows as the web dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.19+
- Dart SDK 3.2+
- Android Studio or Xcode for platform builds
- An `.env` file generated by the Laravel app so the staging API is available

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and generate code:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Launch the dev flavor after exporting the appropriate API base URL in
`lib/core/config/environment.dart`:

```bash
flutter run --flavor dev -d <device-id>
```

The app now sends the `X-Orbas-Client` header and an `OrbasLearn/<version>`
user agent for backend analytics. Update the bundle identifiers and icons once
the remaining rebrand tasks land.

Refer to `../../docs/mobile-roadmap.md` for pending work on Riverpod state
management, offline caching, and push notifications.
